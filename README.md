# [Project Name] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Dabba

### Project Description
MOOC Academy is a fun, full-featured online course platform where users can sign up, enroll in various cool courses, and earn certificates ‚Äî all on one page!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
There are just way too many educational platforms out there with too many features... who needs all that? We fixed that by making one that‚Äôs simple and does everything in one neat scroll.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A one-page website that lets you:

Sign up / Log in
Browse quirky courses
Enroll in a popup
Watch video lectures after enrolling
Track progress and get a (totally real) certificate ‚Äî all on localStorage üòé
