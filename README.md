# [Project Name] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Dabba

### Project Description
The Moustache Meter is a wildly unnecessary tool that scans a photo of your face, counts the number of moustache hairs you have, and gives you a personality "reading" based on your follicle density.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Society is crumbling because people have no clue how grown their moustache is. Is it a baby stache? Is it wise? The confusion is real (not really).

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We count the hairs. You get a fortune. We all pretend moustache science is a thing. Upload an image, let us detect your face and moustache, count the hairs, and rate your moustache journey ‚Äî from baby to beard legend.
