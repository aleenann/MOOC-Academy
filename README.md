# MOOC Academy üéØ
Or should we say... MOOK Academy? üëÉ

## Basic Details
### Team Name: Dabba


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Aleena Ann Francis - Adi Shankara Institute of Engineering and Technology
- Member 2: Afna TA - Adi Shankara Institute of Engineering and Technology


### Project Description
A full-fledged MOOC platform‚Ä¶ or so it seems üëÄ
Users can sign up, choose courses from top professors worldwide, enroll, and even get certificates.
BUT the only course content is ‚Äî how to draw a nose.
Because ‚Äúmook‚Äù (pronounced mooc) means nose in Malayalam. You're welcome.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People desperately need access to high-quality, internationally certified tutorials...
...on drawing noses.
But sadly, no one has stepped up to solve this massive crisis.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built an immersive, fully functional MOOC platform ‚Äî
...that only teaches how to draw a nose.
In the name of education, deception, and mild trolling.
